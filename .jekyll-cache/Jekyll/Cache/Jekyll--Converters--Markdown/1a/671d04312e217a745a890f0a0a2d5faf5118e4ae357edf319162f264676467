I"ç<p>A T-shaped person is someone who is capable in many things and an expert in at least one. This is a phrase I learnt about recently and I like to think it justifies the meandering way that I go around in my passion to learn.</p>

<p>I am regularly falling down the rabbit hole on random topics such as django, jekyll, JIRA query language, Powershell use and more. These are skills that I will sometimes learn for a few days or a week and then use infrequently or not at all.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m able to do this currently whilst I am away from deadlines and work pressures. I pursue anything that I enjoy and I enjoy the the process of learning as much as anything. Iâ€™m not becoming a master in many of the things Iâ€™m doing. I am learning for the explicit purpose of applying it to solve a problem or complete a task I have and then putting it aside when itâ€™s no longer needed.</p>

<p>Discovering the phrase a â€˜T-shaped personâ€™ makes me feel much better about this shallow knowledge grab thatâ€™s going on as one day this may allow me to help out an expert dealing with a bottleneck. I may be able to help with my knowledge take some of his/her area to help the team deal with itâ€™s workload.</p>

<p>The need for â€˜I-shapedâ€™ people is rarer today than in the past, especially in the tech/web industry. You donâ€™t only want an expert in data analysis methods, you want an expert in data analysis with some business strategy, communication skills, ML knowledge and data vis. Thereâ€™s little use for an expert data analysis who doesnâ€™t know how to provide answers to questions the business needs answered.</p>
