I"_<p>A T-shaped person is someone who is capable in many things and an expert in at least one. This is a phrase I learnt about recently and I like to think it justifies the meandering way that I go around in my passion to learn.</p>

<p>I am regularly falling down the rabbit hole on random topics such as django, jekyll, JIRA query language, Powershell use and more. These are skills that I will sometimes learn for a few days or a week and then use infrequently or not at all.</p>
