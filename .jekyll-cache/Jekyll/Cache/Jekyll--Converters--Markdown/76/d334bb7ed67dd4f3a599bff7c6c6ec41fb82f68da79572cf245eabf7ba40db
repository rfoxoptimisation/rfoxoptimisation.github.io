I"á<p>Whilst I was at Eurostar, our success metric tracking for AB tests came via Google Analytics. Often we needed to use BigQuery to pull out greater granularity in the data. Once we had the data, weâ€™d parse that into Jupyter Labs/Notebooks and run the appropriate hypothesis tests there.</p>

<p>Why we didnâ€™t use a testing platform for our analysis is because the tool used changed a few times while I was there as our technical needs changed i.e. moving to react, client-side to server side. Therefore this meant that we wanted to ensure that our implementation was testing tool agnostic.</p>
