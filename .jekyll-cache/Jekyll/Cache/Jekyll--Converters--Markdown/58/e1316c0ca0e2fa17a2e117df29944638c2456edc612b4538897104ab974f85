<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Fox, a digital analytics and experimentation expert and aspirational data scientist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-fox-70889380/">LinkedIn profile</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently taking some time off working to travel with my partner around Latin America. We plan to be away for some time and I plan on using some of the extra time relaxing, relaxing with a good course on statistics, data science, python or any other data related or more general programming related thing.</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>

<p>I come from a numerate background studying Mathematics until I attained my Masterâ€™s degree from the University of Sheffield. During the course I focused on pure mathematics and statistics. Some of my statistical projects involved analysing what are the indicators for success for a country competing in the Olympics and analysis medical studies into the effects of mobile phones on our health. My final dissertation was on Gamma and Beta functions and I can tell you very little about it now as itâ€™s long since gone from my memory.</p>

<p>Since then, I moved into digital analytics where I felt my degree would be useful. Working for Oracle Maxymiser, an AB and MVT testing platform, as part of their client services allowed me to satisfy my analytical itch but still be able to come out from behind the computer and interact with people presenting the analysis and learning to deal with all types of customers.</p>

<p>After a short break away I moved in-house to Eurostar where the previous Optimisation Manager finished the signing up of a testing tool before jetting off to live in Australia. My first contract, it was my job to build a test and learn culture in the business and get optimising. Some big wins soon brought about the test and learn culture and by the end of 9 months, we were an optimisation focused team of three working across all digital channels. I returned to Eurostar after 14 months abroad for another 18 months where the team became four and the way we worked with the product teams shifted.</p>

<p>It was during my return to Eurostar that I began to crave deeper use of my Mathematics. I enjoyed being the go-to Statistician in our team but wanted more than the maths behind frequentist or Bayesian statistics. The craze for data science and machine learning was in full swing by this point and I fully allowed myself to be swept up in it. I have since started and semi-completed numerous online courses and was lucky enough to use Python to optimise a lot of the processes we found ourselves doing at Eurostar such as pulling the analysis directly from BigQuery into a Jupyter Notebook for each experiment giving all the figures we desire for deeper understanding of our tests.</p>

<p>Now that I have left, I am delving deeper whenever I find something of interest and will be looking to broaden my experience in the data science world.</p>
