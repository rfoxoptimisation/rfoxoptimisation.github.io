I"Å<p>I‚Äôm currently taking some time off working to travel with my partner around Latin America. We plan to be away for some time and I plan on using some of the extra time relaxing‚Ä¶ relaxing with a good course on statistics, data science, python or any other data related or more general programming related thing.</p>

<!--description-->

<p>Whilst not everyone‚Äôs idea of a holiday activity, this is a different type of holiday. I‚Äôm not in a rush to see things before I have to fly back home. I have see things, relax, and take on more personal development. For example, learning to speak Spanish is a key part of why I‚Äôm returning to Latin America, where I previously spent nine months.</p>

<p>I have an interest in developing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>my language skills - both Spanish, in schools and in every day living, and French, with my girlfriend. It is a dream of mine to become proficient in a foreign language to be able to converse with the people around me</li>
  <li>my data science, visualisation and analytics skills</li>
  <li>my programming ability - trying to stay as relevant as possible to real world uses and not be distracted by making games or learning complicated frameworks of which I‚Äôm unlikely to utilise</li>
  <li>my SQL knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog will focus on the data and programming related side of my development and I will try and be regular in my updates.</p>
