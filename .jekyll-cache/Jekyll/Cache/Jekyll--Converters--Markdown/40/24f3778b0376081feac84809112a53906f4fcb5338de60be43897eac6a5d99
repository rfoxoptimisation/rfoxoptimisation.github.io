<p>Whilst I have no intention of making this blog about books and their reviews, I do like to read and feel it would be useful to note some things I learned from reading ‘The Power of Habit’ by Charles Duhigg. I feel these are relevant to my personal development.</p>

<p>In this post are a few things I learnt and will be trying to utilise to create some good habits and get rid of some bad ones.</p>
