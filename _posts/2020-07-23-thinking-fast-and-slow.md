5 stars. Highly recommended.

This book took me around 4-5 months to finish. I read it while reading other books at the same time and came back to it when I felt able to truly absorb it's rich content. It is absolutely jam-packed full of insights into the mind and the way we think. It is the amalglamation of a life's work for Daniel Kahneman, a nobel laureate. Much of the work is from his partnership working with Amos Tversky.

**I loved it.** It is well worth the read. I came away from each chapter with a better understanding for the way the mind works that I had to sit and think about for a while.

<!--description-->

Even having read *The Undoing Project* by Michael Lewis previously, which covers the relationship of Kahneman and Tversky and explains many of the their findings, I was blown away by the amount of content in this book.

I actually read this book sometime last year but have not written up a review because I wanted to try and describe some of the heuristics, cognitive biases, effects and general things that Kahneman and Tversky discovered and demonstrated. However, each one essentially gets its own chapter in the book and I won't be able to explain any of them half as well. I will just name some of the ones that stuck with me to give a flavour for the sorts of things covered in the book.

- Regression to the mean
- Confirmation bias - the tendency for people to be more likely to find/search for information and arguments that support their point of view.
- The Peak-end rule - I'll write a separate post on this rule
- Availability bias - people see something as more common than they actually are if they can easily recall cases of it happening
- The Anchoring Effect - we are all influenced by numbers in many incredible and subconscious ways (this effect astounded me)
- The Halo Effect - if we like someone, we are more likely to think better of them in many ways that we actually have no reason to

This really only scratches the surface of some of the incredible things in the book. I read *Thinking Fast and Slow* as an eBook and I will purchasing the paperback now that I'm home so that I can flick through it and be reminded of the incredible cognitive biases our minds come up with.
