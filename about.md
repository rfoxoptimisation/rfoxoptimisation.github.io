[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-fox-70889380/)

I'm currently taking some time off working to travel with my partner around Latin America. We plan to be away for some time and I plan on using some of the extra time relaxing, relaxing with a good course on statistics, data science, python or any other data related or more general programming related thing.

I'm a digital analytics and experimentation professional with 4+ years experience both agency and in-house with a mathematics and statistics background. I'm open to short-term contracts working remotely whilst I'm away

This blog is a personal project of mine where I'll document some of the personal development I'm working on.
