Hi, I'm Ryan Fox, a digital analytics and experimentation expert and aspirational data scientist.

[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-fox-70889380/)

For the last three years, I've been using Python in my work to help create reproduceable analysis and speed up processes. I'm currently looking for my first data-science role after my most-recent contract with Eurostar was cut short in light of low trading levels.

## My background

![Sheffield logo ><](https://seeklogo.com/images/U/University_of_Sheffield-logo-27226177CB-seeklogo.com.png){:height="60px"}{:style="padding: 20px"}

I come from a numerate background studying Mathematics until I attained my Master's degree from the University of Sheffield. During the course I focused on pure mathematics and statistics. Some of my statistical projects involved analysing what are the indicators for success for a country competing in the Olympics and analysis medical studies into the effects of mobile phones on our health. My final dissertation was on Gamma and Beta functions and I can tell you very little about it now as it's long since gone from my memory.

Since then, I moved into digital analytics where I felt my degree would be useful. Working for Oracle Maxymiser, an AB and MVT testing platform, as part of their client services allowed me to satisfy my analytical itch but still be able to come out from behind the computer and interact with people presenting the analysis and learning to deal with all types of customers.

After a short break away I moved in-house to Eurostar where the previous Optimisation Manager finished the signing up of a testing tool before jetting off to live in Australia. My first contract, it was my job to build a test and learn culture in the business and get optimising. Some big wins soon brought about the test and learn culture and by the end of 9 months, we were an optimisation focused team of three working across all digital channels. I returned to Eurostar after 14 months abroad for another 18 months where the team became four and the way we worked with the product teams shifted.

It was during this 18 month stint that I began to use Python to help simplify some of our processes and work better as a team. I've always leant more towards the more technical part of my role, being hands on with web development languages and SQL. Using Python led me towards data science, a craze in full swing that I allowed myself to be swept up in.

I've always craved more Mathematics and statistics in my role, a passion sparked from a young age in understanding numbers. After reading a few articles on various data science topics and falling down many rabbit holes for technical concepts, I knew that data science was a field where I could satisfy my craving for problems to be solved and Mathematics to be understood.

After these 18 months, I went abroad again, this time with my girlfriend Laura. We were away for around a year before the pandemic hit and we had to come home. Since then, I've been working with a couple of charities to help them get more from their websites and I've also worked out most of a 3 month contract with Eurostar before poor trading levels meant many staff being cut.

## Work with me

As of Winter 2020, I'm actively looking for my first data science role. I am looking for a company to invest their time in me so that I can invest in the company.
