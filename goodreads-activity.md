I love to read and use Goodreads to line up future reads and keep track of what I've already read.

I tend to have a few books on the go at all times, generally one fiction, one or more non-fiction and one in a new language I'm hoping to learn.

I read more than one book at a time because sometimes halfway through reading a non-fiction book, I will be excited to read something else. Rather than power on through the non-fiction book that I'm reading for the sake of completing it so I can read another, I will start a second or third book and come back to the original book when my interest is up again.
