Jekyll help

To publish to a local server, simply use

    jekyll server

If you want to specify a hostname rather than the one they give you automatically, you can add `port: #` with # as 8080 for example.

To build the site to production, you simply have to push the changes to GitHub and these should update accordingly.

Still not sure what's going on with

    jekyll build
