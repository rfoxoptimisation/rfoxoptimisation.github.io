I love to read, normally reading through one or two books a week, and read for pleasure. I read mostly fiction but also sometimes books on data and statistics.

Under this category, you'll mostly see book reviews.

Below you can see the last six books I've read. If you'd like to see what I'm currently reading and some of my more recent reading activity, check [here]({{site.baseurl}}/reading-activity).

<div class="recent-reading">
{% include goodreads-widgets/last-6-read.html %}
<p class="readmore">
    <a href="{{ "/reading-activity" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><data data-icon="ei-arrow-right"></data>See more
    </a>
</p>
</div>
