This is something I discovered reading in the book 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman.

## Peak-end rule

It's fascinating that people's memories of events can be completely different to their experience of it. Your relationship can look like a complete failure because of how it ended, instead of it being an incredible time but with a sad ending.

The peak end rule says that your memory of an experience can be rated as the average of your feeling at it's peak and at it's end. For example, say you get a 60 minute Balinese massage. You rank your pleasure on a scale of 1-10 throughout. It's possible that you don't enjoy the first 20 minutes and rank your pleasure as a 4 during this. Then have an incredible 10 minutes of bliss you rank an 10. Then you have another 20 minutes at a 4. The masseur finishes strong with an amazing head massage and you give an 8 for the final 10 minutes.

Objectively, you've had 40 minutes or two-thirds of your massage where you are dissapointed and give a four. However, there was a peak in the middle where you gave a 10 and then a strong end where you gave an 8. Studies show that whilst your experience of the massage would not have been the most enjoyable, when asked how it was, your memory of the massage is heavily influenced by the peak and the end and that you would rate your experience as a 9 (the average of the 10 and the 8).

Similarly, if you had a massage where for 50 minutes you loved it but the final 10 minutes were not great, you might say the massage was ruined by the final 10 minutes. This isn't true, you still had a great 50 minutes and what you experienced can't be changed. It's your memory of the experience that has been impacted.

## Duration neglect

Duration neglect was illustrated by a study done where subjects were asked to submerge their hand in painfully cold water. Each participant endured two cold-hand episodes:

- Short episode - 60 seconds of immersion at 14 degrees celsius. At the end, they are asked to remove their hand and given a warm towel.

- Long episode - 90 seconds in total. The first 60 seconds were identical to the short episode but at 60 seconds the experimenter remained silent and opened a valve to allow slightly warmer water into the tub., raising the temperature very subtly by 1 degree, just enough for the subjects to detect a slight decrease in pain.

Subjects were subjected to both episodes with half being given the short episode first and half the long episode first before a seven minute break followed by the other episode. Which hand was used was also controlled to ensure a fair test. They were then told that one of their experiences would be repeated exactly but that they were free to choose which experience they wanted to repeat: the one with their left or right hand.

80% of participants chose the long episode to repeat. The peak-end rule is to blame here as it explains why the short episode leaves a worse memory than the long episode. Further, the duration is not important as a result. Therefore, participants were unknowingly willing to suffer 30 seconds of needless pain extra in the third trial.
