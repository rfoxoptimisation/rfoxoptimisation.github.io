I'm heading back home for a few weeks after 4 months in South America and I wanted to provide an update on how my learning is progressing.

## Things I've learnt

- 75% of the way through Automate the Boring stuff
- learnt how to run python programs from the command line
- Built a whatsapp chat analyser first draft
- Decided I wanted to complete the Python for Data Science career track on Datacamp - 7 modules completed, 19 to go. Will aim to complete one per week (~4 hours per week)
- HackerRank 30 days of code and 10 days of stats
- Building a travel website using Jekyll - starting from scratch

## Things I'm working through

- Automate the boring stuff Udemy course
- Datacamp Data Scientist in Python career track

## Plans for projects

- Kaggle competitions (finally!)
- Build a travel blog website from scratch using Jekyll

## Thoughts on my approach to learning

- Focus more on problems and doing them
- Structured/timetabled approach to courses to ensure finishing them
