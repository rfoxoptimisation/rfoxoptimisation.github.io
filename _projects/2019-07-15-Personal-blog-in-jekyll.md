After running many AB tests on websites and often coding the tests myself, I have picked up a fair amount of web development skills. Although, I had never created a website before, only added improvements to those already made, I was keen not to use a CMS such as Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix, etc. as I felt with each, you are tied into a template that's difficult to manipulate.

To add custom CSS, JS or HTML often required some sort of higher, paid-for subscription, and all of them cost money in one way or another, unless if you want their ads all over your site.

This is why I chose to create a website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that allows you to pick templates if you want or completely create your own.

I decided to use a [theme](https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple) created by another user and tailor it to my needs as I went along.

Jekyll gives you full flexibility to control the way your site is structured and designed. Whilst Wordpress and Wix and other website builders might make it a bit easier to get up and running quickly, in my experience I found it frustrating not being able to make things exactly how I wanted.

For those familiar to Github and using the CLI, it's the perfect solution and completely free to get a professional website out there quickly. It is possible to have a good looking website out in only 10 or so minutes, using themes other users have created.
