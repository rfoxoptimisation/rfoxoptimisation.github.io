Very much a work in progress, I have been building out a simple travel website through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. It has been mine and Laura's idea to build a simple way to document our progress around the world. We looked at a few different ways to do this but in the end we decided to build one out using Jekyll.

<!--description-->

Jekyll gives you full flexibility to control the way your site is structured and designed. Whilst Wordpress and Wix and other website builders might make it a bit easier to get up and running quickly, we found it frustrating not being able to make things exactly how we wanted them. Further, you need to pay to get rid of the branding from the website builder. Jekyll gives full flexibility and it's still simple to maintain the website and update it often.

It's also very quick to get up and running with it, although there is a fairly steep learning curve for those not so familiar with the command line and github. However, for those used to using Github and some CLI usage, it's the perfect solution and completely free to get a professional website out there quickly. It is possible to have a good looking website out in only 10 or so minutes, using themes other users have created. Laura and I decided to start without a theme and build out our own one.

It's very much a work in progress but you can view the website [here]({{ '/travel' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
